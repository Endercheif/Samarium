# `types` module

The `types` module implements data types not built-in to the language itself.

## Boolean

The Boolean type can have value either `true` or `false`.

Booleans can be initialized with either a string with the value `"true"` or `"false"`, or a truthy/falsy value.
Booleans support several operations: all comparison operations, all arithmetic operations, all bitwise operations, and can be used with logical operators, and converted to a string (specifically either `"true"` or `"false"`).
