## Assignment

All arithmetic and bitwise operators (except `~`) can be used together with the assignment operator.

For example:

<p align="left">
    <img src="images/03operators.png" style="transform: scale(0.6)">
</p>

is equivalent to:

<p align="left">
    <img src="images/04assignoperators.png" style="transform: scale(0.6)">
</p>
